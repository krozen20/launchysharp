Launchy#: .NET plugins for Launchy
========================================
New features in this version:
-----------------------
 * Support for a configuration dialog in the "Options->Plugins" window. See the
   notes below, the documentation CHM and the Go-Y# plugin source for more details.
 * Two more API functions: launchyShow(), launchyHide()
 * A new function in LaunchyPaths: getConfigPath(). You can use this function
   for saving plugin-specific settings.

Notes about the options window
-----------------------
 * Related API functions are hasDialog(), doDialog(), endDialog().
 * The Go-Y# plugin demonstrates a simple usage of this feature.
 * At the moment, only WinForms windows were tested. Please contact the author
   through the SourceForge project page for feedback about your experience with
   WPF or other frameworks.

Known issues:
-----------------------
 * Init is called more than once. Happens because Launchy calls init twice at the begining, and every time the Options window is opened.

Currently missing in the API
-----------------------
Several parts of the Launchy plugin API are not implemented at the moment:
 * Unloading a .NET plugin (you can remove or rename the plugin DLL instead).
 * Support for accessing the global Launchy settings object (QSettings).
 * The runProgram function
